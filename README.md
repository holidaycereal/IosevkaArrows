# Iosevka Arrows

I really really like Iosevka but I don't like the ligatures for the fat arrows (`=>`, `>>=`, `>=>`, etc.). I think this composite style is much less distracting.

I have only made a few changes to the file `packages/font-glyphs/src/symbol/ligation.ptl` which simplify how the shapes for these ligatures are generated.
